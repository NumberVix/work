		description: "This was a private project developed specifically to maintain efficency in one large community ran by myself with a team of 3. The purpose of this bot was to allow users to direct message an automated 'Help' user, in where all direct messages received by this 'user' (the bot) would be relayed back to a group for the entire management team to see, meaning all queries can be answered quickly and easily. I cannot release the full source code for this bot, however here is a preview of the code, showing the main index file in the root directory. (https://pastebin.com/ePurcDVn) The full source code is 73 MB, and the directory contains over 14,000 files, with over 1,750 folders.

		description: "I developed this in Python, as a private script to protect the piracy of some of my work. This is a very small piece of code to protect the code of my Python application, which I sell. A copy of this sales page which I sell the bot can be found at: 'https://numbervix.github.io/VixBotCommands.' This authorization script grabs the user's hardware ID, contacts a web page through a URL, and allows the user access to the application if their HWID is listed. If not, access is denied. A simple yet very effective script. Code: https://pastebin.com/6YX1D0HE "
